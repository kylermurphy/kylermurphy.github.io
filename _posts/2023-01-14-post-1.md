Have you found your Anaconda enviroments _stalling_ when trying to install new packages via ```conda```? 

Well Anaconda has just incorporated a [new dependency solver ```libmamba```][1] which is [signifcantly faster][3] then the base solver. 

Wehn trying to update single packages in my reserch Python _environment_ I've found that [```libmamba```][2] was able to rapidly solve the dependencies and install the required packages when the base ```conda``` solver completely failed (headache territory).

Have a look at using the [new solver][1] yourself, and hopefully it will help you to avoid the issues I was having.

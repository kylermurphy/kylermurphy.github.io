I am an Assistant Researcher at the University of Maryland's Department of Astronomy and Contractor at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. My research focus is in Space Weather and the dynamics of the magnetosphere during Geomagnetic Storms and Substorms.

During Geomagnetic Storms I use multi-point observations from both space- and ground-based instruments to quantify the response of the Earth's radiation belt to enhanced solar wind driving and geomagnetic activity. During Substorms, periods of enhanced geomagnetic activity characterized by vibrant auroral displays, I use ground-based imagers and magnetometers to quantify the dynamics of the ionosphere and magnetosphere. In my research I enjoy developing statistical studies, working with large datasets, and learning about, employing, and developing new data analysis and statistical techniques to quantify fundamental physical and Space Weather processes.

## Recent Work

**Research:** My paper [A Framework for Understanding and Quantifying the Loss and Acceleration of Relativistic Electrons in the Outer Radiation Belt During Geomagnetic Storms][1] was highligted in the July 2020 Space Weather Qauterly and featured on the cover of [Space Weather Volume 18, Issue 5][2]. From the Qauterly - *A new framework to understand radiation belt content during geomagnetic storms is presented, with an initial loss phase followed by a enhancement phase. The response is found to be independent of the driver type but dependent on the solar wind input and magnetosphere state. Radiation belt loss is organized by the location of the magnetopause and the strength of Dst and ultra-low frequency (ULF) wave power. The radiation belt enhancements are organized by the amplitude of ULF waves, the auroral electroject index, and solar wind energy input*.

The [Magnetosphere Online Seminar Series][3] was established by myself and David Sibeck in response to the cancelation of several scientific meetings and to encourage continued interaction within the Space Physics community during the Covid-19 pandemic. The series hosts weekly seminars on Zoom and YouTube live streams. You can learn more about the series on the Magnetosphere Online Seminar Series [website][3], see upcoming seminars on the [schedule][4], read about previous seminars on the [Blog][5], and watch previous seminars on the [YouTube channel][6].

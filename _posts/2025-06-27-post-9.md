[JB2008](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2008-6438) is an emperical atmospheric neutral density model (long name Jacchia-Bowman 2008). It is the most recent itteration of the Jacchia-Bowman family at atmospheric models and incorporates both Solar and Geomagnetic activity into the modelling of atmospheric neutral denisty, temperature, and exospheric temperature.

The model is written in [Fortran](https://spacewx.com/jb2008/) and has been translated to other languages including Python (e.g., [Pyatmos](https://github.com/PyAtmos/PyAtmos)) and Matlab(e.g., [DESTO](https://github.com/davidgondelach/DESTO)). Models predictions can also be requested through [NASA's CCMC](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/JB2008~2008/). 

The [Pyatmos](https://github.com/PyAtmos/PyAtmos) is particularly useful as it provides a wrapper to run JB2008 in Python, arguabally the most popular language for research, data science and machine learning. However, [Pyatmos](https://github.com/PyAtmos/PyAtmos) can be slow when performing a large number of predictions. This can inhibit larger studies which require a larger number of predictions (e.g., statistical or machine learning studies). 

To that end I set out to speed up the Python version of JB2008 by vectorizing portions of the code as well as leveraging parallelization. The vectorization is applied to a number of input and data prep functions. The parallelization takes advantage of the [swifter](https://github.com/jmcarpenter2/swifter) module which first aims to vectorize a function call and then determines if Dask should can be used to speed up code via parallel processing. The combination of vectorization and [swifter](https://github.com/jmcarpenter2/swifter) signifcantly speeds up JB2008 predictions. When ran on colab the vector-parallelized codes sees an **~11x** speed boost compared to [Pyatmos](https://github.com/PyAtmos/PyAtmos), 40s compared to nearly 8 minutes when predicting density for ~70,000 points (see below). On faster machines, the same calculation can take as little as 20 seconds!

The vector-parallelized code can be found [here](https://github.com/kylermurphy/jb2008).

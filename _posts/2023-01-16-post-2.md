Ever been actively editing a module while also using it? IPython (and JUPYTER) have some automagic to help with this. 

[```autoreload```][1] reloads modules before excuting a line a code. If you're working with some code and modify it you can use the below to ensure that the changes are applied before reexcuting the code.

```
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

**Note**, if you are loading a module by adding it to you sysem path be sure to import the module using ```import``` rather then ```import module as mod```, for example. When using ```import as``` it doesn't appear as though the autoreload magic works.

Read more about it at this [stackoverflow post][2].

I recently earned my physics PhD from Montana State University (MSU) in Bozeman, Montana working with Dr. John Sample. Currently I am working at The NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, supported by The NASA Postdoctoral Program fellowship, and working with Dr. Lauren Blum.

I study in-situ energetic particle precipitation observed by various magnetospheric CubeSats, and larger missions such as NASA's Van Allen Probes. I analyze data and make models that attempt to link observations to our best guess at reality. The published projects I was involved in are listed in the [Publications](/publications/) section and my work experiance is summarized in the [CV](/cv) section.

My current and future research interestes are described in the [Research](/research/) section.

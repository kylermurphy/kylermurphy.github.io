During Geomagnetic Storms I use multi-point observations from both space- and ground-based instruments to quantify the response of the Earth's radiation belt to enhanced solar wind driving and geomagnetic activity. During Substorms, periods of enhanced geomagnetic activity characterized by vibrant auroral displays, I use ground-based imagers and magnetometers to quantify the dynamics of the ionosphere and magnetosphere. In my research I enjoy developing statistical studies, working with large datasets, and learning about, employing, and developing new data analysis and statistical techniques to quantify fundamental physical and Space Weather processes.

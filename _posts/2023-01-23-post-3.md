Experiencing weird scaling issues with Spyder? 

I recently got a new laptop with a very nice screen... the downside, Spyder didn't render very nicely on it. Luckily there was a simple fix identified by [Emmanuel Contreras][1] (see this [stackoverflow post][3] too).

1. Locate your [```qt.conf file```][2].
1. Modify the qt.conf file by adding or modifying the line:
  ```
  [Platforms]
  WindowsArguments = dpiawareness=0
  ```
3. Restart Spyder

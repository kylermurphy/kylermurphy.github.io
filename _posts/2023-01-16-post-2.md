Ever been actively editing a module while also using it? IPython (and JUPYTER) have some automagic to help with this. 

[```autoreload```][1] reloads modules before excuting a line a code. If you're working with some code and modify it you can use the below to ensure that the changes are applied before reexcuting the code.

```
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

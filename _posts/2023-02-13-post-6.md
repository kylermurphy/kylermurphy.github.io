Having problems accessing Anaconda from VS Code (```Python: Select Interpreter```)? 

If you're using Windows and installed Anaconda locally, for one user as opposed for everyone, or haven't added Anaconda to the Windows Path then VS Code may have troubles finding it. 

Luckily there is a simple solution. If your ```conda``` version is >4.6 then you can run ```conda init``` from the __base__ conda environment. This will initialize ```conda``` for shell interaction. In Windows this defaults to the ```cmd``` and ```powershell``` shells.

If you have an older version first update ```conda``` with ```conda update conda```.
